Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and We may terminate your Account because of it. User Content: If you transmit or upload User Content on the Service, you agree that it will be: 1) accurate; 2) not confidential; 3) not in violation of the law; 4) not in violation of contractual restrictions or other parties� rights, and that you have permission from any other party whose personal or other information or intellectual property is contained within the User Content;

When you post your observations and comments on the Service such as in forums, blogs and chat features, We cannot guarantee that other players will not use the ideas and information that you share. If you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential and/or don�t want others to use, don�t post it. POKERACE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OTHER PERSON�S USE OR APPROPRIATION OF ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU POST IN ANY FORUMS, BLOGS AND CHAT ROOMS. 

7. MONITORING USE OF SERVICE AND USER CONTENT We have no obligation to monitor User Content and We are not responsible for monitoring the Service for inappropriate or illegal User Content or conduct by other players. That said, We have the right, in our sole discretion, to edit, refuse to post, or remove any User Content. We may also, at our discretion, choose to monitor and/or record your interaction with the Service or your communications with Pokerace or other players (including without limitation chat text and voice communications) when you are using the Service. We are not responsible for information, materials, products or Service/s provided by other players (for instance, in their profiles). However, if someone is violating these Terms or misusing the Service, please let Us know by using a "Report Abuse" link provided in the Service or contact Us at Customer Support. 

8. YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER PLAYERS You are responsible for your interactions with other players. If you have a problem with another player, We are not required to get involved, but We can if We desire. If you have a dispute with another player, you release Pokerace and its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and employees, and all Pokerace Affiliates from responsibility, claims, demands and/or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, resulting from that dispute or connected to that dispute. This includes damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use or data. 

9. PAYMENT TERMS We provide a service in the form of access to games and Virtual Items. In the Service you may use "real world" money to obtain a limited license to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or Service/s. How it Works: You get a limited license to Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games, providing your billing information, confirming your request and re-affirming your agreement to these Terms. On Racingpoker.com, the payment page will let you know what you can use to pay when you make your purchase. We may change what you can use to pay from time to time, at Our sole discretion. Virtual Items purchased in Our games on other platforms such as Facebook, Apple iOS, or Android will be subject to those platforms� payment Terms & Conditions of Service. Pokerace does not control how you can pay on those platforms. Please review those platforms� terms of service for additional information. When you get a limited license to use Virtual Items from our Service/s on racingpoker.com, We may send you a confirmation email or text that will have details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmation message are correct as soon as possible and keep a copy of it for your records. Pokerace keeps records of transactions in order to deal with any future questions about that transaction. For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to Us to obtain a limited license for the relevant service(s) or virtual in-game item(s) which will be accepted by Us when We make the Virtual Items available in your account for you to use in our games or debit your credit card or other account through which you paid, whichever comes first. Your limited licence to Virtual Items for use in Pokerace games is a service provided by Pokerace that starts when We accept your payment or redemption of third party virtual currency (if applicable). For orders to obtain a limited licence to use Virtual Items, by clicking the button on the purchase window or page you: 1) agree that We may start to supply your purchased Virtual Items immediately after you have clicked that button; and 2) if you reside in the European Union, you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU's Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item. You understand that while you may �earn� "buy" or "purchase" Virtual Items in our Service/s, You do not legally "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any "virtual currency" balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license. ALL SALES ARE FINAL: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT POKERACE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH POKERACE.COM OR ANOTHER PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICE/S. Third Party Virtual Currency: You may also obtain a limited licence to use Virtual Items by redeeming Pokerace third party virtual currency. PURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF THIRD PARTY VIRTUAL CURRENCY TO ACQUIRE A LICENSE TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW. If you purchase third party currency or choose to make a payment in our Service/s through a third party (like Facebook, Apple, or Google), you are agreeing to the third party�s payment terms, and Pokerace is not a party to the transaction. Additional Payment Terms: You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. Pokerace may revise the pricing for the goods and Service/s it licenses to you through the Service at any time. Subscriptions (if available) are also subject to additional terms, which can be found at Subscription Terms when they are available. Billing Support: For billing support please email admin@racingpoker.com 

10. PROMOTIONS AND OFFERS From time to time, We may offer limited time promotions. Please review the official rules (if any) associated with the promotion. They will apply in addition to these Terms. In addition, from time to time, We may promote Offers. We are not required to give, and players are not required to accept, any Offer. Offers are not transferable, redeemable or exchangeable for other things of value outside of the Service/s. If you accept any Offer, you may have to sign a declaration of eligibility and liability release, or agree to Additional Terms in order to get the Offer. Some Offers will be subject to taxes and other charges, travel, or activities outside of the virtual world, all of which will be disclosed before You accept the offer. If you accept an Offer you also assume all liability associated with the Offer. 

11.THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING Our Service and our games may feature advertisements from Us or other companies. Our Privacy Policy explains what information We share with advertisers. Please read it. Sometimes We provide links in Our games or on the Service to other companies� websites or to companies who invite you to participate in a promotional offer and offer you some feature of the Service or upgrade (such as in-game currency) in exchange. Any charges or obligations you take on in dealing with these other companies are your responsibility. We make no representation or promises about any content, goods or Service/s these other companies provide, even if linked to or from Our Service or games. Also, just because We allow a link to be included in Our games or Service does not mean We endorse that linked site. We are not liable for any claim relating to any content, goods and/or Service/s of third parties. Please also note that the linked sites are not under our control and may collect data or ask you to provide them with your personal or other information, or they may automatically collect information from you. When you use other companies� Service/s like these, the other company�s service may (or may not) ask you for permission to access your information and content. We are not responsible for these other companies� content, business practices or privacy policies, or for how they collect, use or share the information they get from you. Your relationship with that other company will control how it can use, store, and share your information. 

12. COPYRIGHT NOTICES/COMPLAINTS We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you should, too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (�DMCA�) and similar or equivalent local laws that may apply. We reserve the right to terminate any player's access to the Service if We determine that the player is a "repeat infringer." We do not have to notify the player before We do this. We also accommodate and do not interfere with standard technical measures copyright owners use to protect their materials. 

13. FEEDBACK AND UNSOLICTED IDEAS Any idea, information or feedback you submit to us with or without Our specific request will be deemed as non-confidential and non-proprietary. We may use the information as we see fit without any compensation to you or any third party irrespective of whether We use it or not. 

14. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER; SERVICE/S AVAILABLE ON AN �AS IS� BASIS Neither Pokerace nor any Pokerace Affiliate makes any promise or guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free. USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. IT IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, POKERACE AND ANY POKERACE AFFILIATE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICE/S. POKERACE AND ANY POKERACE AFFILIATE DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. If your state or country does not allow these disclaimers, they do not apply to you. If your state or country requires a certain period for which a warranty applies, it will be either the shorter of 30 days from your first use of the Service or the shortest period required by law. 

15. LIMITATIONS; WAIVERS OF LIABILITY YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WE AND POKERACE AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE 
1) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE; 
2) IF YOU USE THE SERVICE AND IT IS ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO DO SO IN YOU JURISTICTION; 
3) IF YOU LIE TO US ABOUT YOUR AGE; OR 
4) FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICE AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES. THE RISK OF USING THE SERVICE AND EXTERNAL SITES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU AS DOES THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE SERVICE AND EXTERNAL SITES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY ANY LAW THAT APPLIES, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY THE SERVICE, OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE). TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF POKERACE AND/OR THE POKERACE AFFILIATES IS LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID POKERACE AND/OR THE POKERACE AFFILIATE IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM. IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID POKERACE OR ANY POKERACE AFFILIATE ANY AMOUNT IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH POKERACE AND/OR ANY POKERACE AFFILIATE IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICE AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT. Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above. So these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries. 

16. INDEMNITY If you use or misuse the Service, or if you violate these Terms or any other applicable rules, including the Social Policy or Additional Terms, and that results in loss or damage or in a claim or liability against Pokerace or any Pokerace Affiliate, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pokerace and/or the Pokerace Affiliate (which means you agree to compensate Pokerace and/or the Pokerace Affiliate on a "dollar for dollar" basis) for that loss, damage, claim or liability, including compensating Pokerace and/or the applicable Pokerace Affiliate for our legal fees or expenses. If Pokerace or the Pokerace Affiliate wants to, they are allowed to take exclusive charge of the defence of any case on which you are required to compensate or reimburse them, and it will be at your expense. You also have to cooperate in Pokerace�s and/or the Pokerace Affiliate�s defense of these cases. Pokerace and/or the Pokerace Affiliate will use reasonable efforts to let you know if they learn of any claim on which you have to compensate or reimburse them. This will apply even if you stop using the Service/s or your account is deleted. 

17. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support team at admin@pokerace.com.au or try to find a resolution on one of our forums. Most disputes can be resolved that way. If we can�t resolve our dispute through Customer Service or on our forums (coming soon), you and Pokerace or any member of the Pokerace Corporate Group all agree to resolve any claims relating to the Terms, the Privacy Policy, Social Policy, Additional Terms or Pokerace�s Service/s through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions in the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate sub-section. It also applies even after you stopped using your Pokerace account or deleted it. An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so we are all giving up our right to a trial before a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different rules than lawsuits in court. They are less formal than lawsuits in courts, and provide limited opportunity to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute�a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if any of us does not like the arbitrator�s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision. If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate We all agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to: Your, Pokerace�s, or a Pokerace Corporate Group member�s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, patents, domain names, trade secrets or copyright); or your violation of the Social Policy. For more information about which court we can go to for resolving these types of disputes, see Section 19 (Venue for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration). Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in Sydney, New South Wales or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be heard in that court. In addition, if you, Pokerace or a Pokerace Corporate Group member brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You, Pokerace or the Pokerace Corporate Group member may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing. No Class Actions We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. That means: 1) Neither you nor Pokerace nor any member of the Pokerace Corporate Group can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action. 2) The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person�s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this). 

18. APPLICABLE LAW Apart from that these Terms our relationship will be governed by New South Wales law in Australia, except for its conflicts of laws principle. 

19. VENUE FOR LEGAL DISPUTES NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION You and Pokerace both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in Sydney New South Wales Australia. 

20. SEVERABILITY Except as described in Section 17 under the �No Class Actions� heading, if any part of these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy or the Privacy Policy is not enforceable, the rest of these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy and the Privacy Policy still applies and is binding and any unenforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. 

21. ASSIGNMENT We may give our rights, or Our obligations, under these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy, or our Privacy Policy to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not give your rights or your obligations under these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy, or our Privacy Policy without first getting Pokerace�s written consent, and any attempt to do so without our consent is void. 

22. ENTIRE AGREEMENT These Terms, and any other policies or rules We reference in these Terms, make up the entire agreement between you and Us relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and (except in the case of fraud or made a fraudulent misstatement) supersede all prior understandings of the parties relating to the subject matter of these Terms, whether those prior understandings were electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and Us. 

23. LANGUAGE OF THE TERMS If We provide a translated version of these Terms, Additional Terms, the Social Policy, the Pokerace Privacy Policy, or any other terms or policy, it is for informational purposes only. If the translated version means something different than the English version, then the English meaning will be the one that applies. 

24. NO WAIVER If We do not enforce a provision of these Terms, Additional Terms, the Social Policy, or our Privacy Policy, that does not waive our right to do so later. And, if We do expressly waive a provision of these Terms, Additional Terms, the Social Policy or our Privacy Policy that does not mean it is waived for all time in the future. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by both you and Us to be legally binding. 

25. NOTICES We may notify you by posting something on Our Service domain for the Pokerace game(s) you play, and sending you an e-mail or using other ways of communicating with you based on the contact information you provide to Us. If you are a player in the United States, and you have to give Us notice of something according to the Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy, or our Privacy Policy, the notice must be in writing and addressed to Pokerace Inc., Attn: LEGAL DEPARTMENT, biz@pokerace.com.au , unless we have provided a more specific method way of notifying us. Any attempted notice that does not follow these rules has no legal effect. 

26. EQUITABLE REMEDIES You agree that given the unique and irreplaceable nature of the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms and the Social Policy, if you breach these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy and/or our Privacy Policy, or intend to breach these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy or Privacy Policy, money damages alone will not be enough to repair the harm to Pokerace. Therefore, for disputes that are not required to be resolved through arbitration as described in Section 17, Pokerace may seek injunctive or other equitable relief (e.g., get a court order to make you stop doing whatever you�re doing that is causing harm) if you breach or intend to breach these Terms, Additional Terms, Social Policy or our Privacy Policy and Pokerace does not have to post any bond or surety or submit proof of damages. You agree to limit your claims to claims for money damages, as limited by Section 15 (Limitations; Waivers of Liability). And, you agree not to seek injunctive or equitable relief or otherwise seek to stop Us from operating any aspect of the Service or any Pokerace Game. 

27. FORCE MAJEURE We are not liable for any changes or problems out of our control, for example changes or problems caused by like natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labour or materials.

We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text messages) ("Promotional Communications") directly or in partnership with other parties, in accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication will offer you choices about receiving additional messages.

Storage and security of your personal information. 
Pokerace will take reasonable steps to keep any personal information it holds about you secure.  However, except to the extent liability cannot be excluded due to the operation of the statute, Pokerace excludes all liability (including in negligence) for the consequences of any unauthorised access to your personal information.  Please notify Pokerace immediately if you become aware of any breach of security.

Pokerace may store your personal information in hard copy or electronically in Cloud in Melbourne, Australia or the servers of third parties within Australia.
Pokerace implements a range of physical and electronic security measures to protect the personal information that it holds, including:
�	restricted access to our offices;
�	mandatory password protection on all computers (users are required to change their passwords at regular intervals);
�	hardware encryption on desktops, laptops and portable storage devices;
�	secure hard copy document storage, secure electronic storage media and hardware, and secure document disposal procedures;
�	firewall and antivirus/malware software; and
�	systems and application access controls implemented to restrict access to information (on a need to know basis).
Cookies and Automated Information Collection
Pokerace and its service providers (e.g.Google Analytics) store log files and use tracking technologies such as:
�	cookies (being small pieces of data) to transfer information to your mobile device or computer for record-keeping purposes;
�	web beacons, which notifies Pokerace if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened;
�	tracking pixels to allow Pokerace or its advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively; and
�	local shared objects or flash cookies to assist Pokerace to reduce fraud, recall your in-game preferences and speed upload times.

Disclosing and storing personal information overseas.
In the event Pokerace sells or licenses to a third party outside Australia, Pokerace may provide them with details of its users.
However, Pokerace will not send personal information about an individual outside Australia without:
�	obtaining the consent of the individual (in some cases this consent will be implied); or
�	otherwise taking all reasonable steps to ensure such third parties comply with the Australian Privacy Principles or other applicable privacy legislation.
The countries in which these third parties are located will depend on the circumstances and includes our administration support services.
Pokerace may also store personal information in the �Cloud� and other third party Cloud storage facilities, which may mean that it resides on servers which are situated outside Australia.  As these Cloud storage services are provided by independent third parties, the actual location of these servers may change from time to time and is outside Pokerace�s knowledge or control.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy.
From time to time it may be necessary for Pokerace to review and revise its Privacy Policy.  Pokerace reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy at any time.  Pokerace may notify you and other players of any change to its Privacy Policy by placing a notice on Pokerace.com.au or its equivalent RacingPoker.com in-game, or by sending you a notice to your e-mail address noted in its records prior to the change becoming effective or by otherwise informing you that a revised copy of our Privacy Policy is available on request. Pokerace may supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or forums and on other Pokerace websites. You should periodically check www.pokerace.com.au  and this privacy page for updates.

Privacy Policies of Linked Third Party Services and Advertisers.
Pokerace�s websites and games may contain advertisements from Third Party Services who may link to their own websites, online services or mobile applications. Pokerace takes no responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of these Third Party Services.
